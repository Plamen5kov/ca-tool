I would have liked to see a bit more clarification in the solution statement. I understand that the original NFT will be copied on the Cardano blockchain and that it will expand the working area of the artists without minting each blockchain individually.

Just an extra sentence explaining how it would work could make a huge difference in clarifying the solution to the problem. \r\nAlso, what function would this project have when compared to other blockchains that has cheaper fees than Ethereum, like for example Solana?

Not to belittle other proposals that tackle just limited aspects of a challenge, but I think that that a proposal that looks at the entire picture is often a better fit - as it tries to look at comprehensive solutions. That is difficult, but ultimately more rewarding for the Cardano ecosystem. The Cardano-Heartbeat (CEM) proposal is one of those proposals that leaves a very strong impression upon reading it. I think that the team correctly identified basic (but at the same time major) issues that will plague the ragtag band of Cardano SPOs around the world: power failure, network disruptions & hardware failure - and many SPOs are probably not prepared for these events. A global financial operating system must have redundancies inbuilt and must have addressed basic issues such as these. I like the clarity that the proposing team has in its approach and the proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem through the Critical Event Management (CEM) Platform that will provide early notification of relevant threats, automation of incident response activities and resiliency protocol, a rapid recovery of SPOs and even providing assurance to delegators. This is in essence a wide-ranging and comprehensive response to the challenge that aims to help SPOs to a put disaster recovery strategies in place to maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption. The team proposes to develop their Critical Event Management Platform (based on differing technologies and data) in a way that will automate processes. The idea to base everything on an established framework such as the a Threat & Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment & Stakeholder Preparedness Review (THIRA/SPR assessment) is excellent, as it eliminates improvisation and needs to be completed by a certified TEEX Infrastructure Protection Professional.

The challenge brief is wide and I would welcome a wider ranging solution that would encompass more types of threats - as a better fit as it would cover more ground and would represent a better fit to the scope of the challenge.  The risk profile audit will help identify and grade  developing threats - but will inherently be limited by its narrow scope. It targets cybersecurity risks specifically and I think it addresses that narrow segment competently. The proposing team proposes a \"Risk Profile for Cardano stakepool operators who manage individual nodes across the network\". BTW, it is not clear to me from this sentence whether the focus will be stakepool operators who manage \"individual nodes\" only or does the scope also include stakepool operators who manage \"multiple nodes\" - meaning multiple pools, but this does not detract from the score (I presume it means all SPOs). \r\n\r\nMaybe there could be space for using the experience gained in developing templates for independent Stakepool node assessment - for other elements of the Cardano ecosystem as well? Or trying to widen the project to cover more threat sources in a similar fashion? \r\n\r\nUltimately, the proposed solution does not address other novel, emerging systemic threats to the Cardano ecosystem. Other important threat sources, include economic and social threats, or regulatory sources, or operational issues related to the structure of Cardano and its components, major stakeholders, market destabilizing activities, attempts to destabilize the chain from other sources, etc... \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think that the proposers of this challenge are an impressive combination. The right mix of theoretical experience, practical experience in running a stakepool and technology risk professional experience. The proposers' solution is to develop a Risk Profile Cybersecurity Audit for SPOs using NIST, ENISA, and ISO cybersecurity standards. These standards are publically referenced and the proposal includes links to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ENISA Cybersecurity Standards and Certification, and the ISO Information Security Management System (ISMS) Standards. I think that the proposal seems feasible, well in the competencies of the proposing team and would provide some great value. There is something I noticed too. According to the scoring criteria for feasibility a feasible proposal has considered the following aspect as well: (The proposal clearly explains technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation.). So, while the NIST, ENISA and ISO standards are referenced with links, I was trying to explore to learn more about the proposed integration of Cardano stakepools onto the NOXMON C2RM (Control Cyber Risk Management) tool. The tool is not presented in any detail in the proposal and its significance is not explained, so I tried searching for it on my own. From where I am based (on Sep 11) a Google Search reveals only one result (https://noxmon.com/), when I open the webpage I see a page for what is presented as a technology & cyber risk management company. However, the company's page is full of placeholder (dummy) text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without meaningful content. The Case Studies page on this website (http://noxmon.com/project/consumer-products/ ) is non-existent, while the Testimonials page (https://noxmon.com/testimonials/) is full of John Doe (\"Lorem Ipsum\") quotes. Effectively, I am not able to get a picture of what is NOXMON C2RM -  the proposers have not explained to voters the importance of the NOXMON C2RM integration for stakepools and no relevant links have been provided. This NOXMON C2RM integration roughly accounts for one-third of the budget - so this part of the budget is now hanging on a lack of relevant and reliable information. It requires a leap of faith (not a good sign  -when trust needs to be implied, instead of being documented). As for the rest of the budget, the budget is well presented for a proposal of this size and relatable to the activities that are proposed. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, as regards clarity and auditability, or effectively the ability to audit the progress and success there are is some good and some not so good. A roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement has been provided and Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal are there too. But not all key metrics are clear (See NOXMON C2RM below). As regards the solution's clarity, I think that it clearly falls short of addressing a wider scope of problems/threats for the Cardano ecosystem as I feel the spirit of the challenge requires. The proposed solution also lacks links to explain or reference the importance of using the proposed NOXMON C2RM (Control Cyber Risk Management) tool, but that would not be a problem if a simple Google Search were to reveal the answer. Unfortunately, a Google Search opens up more questions about NOXMON C2RM than it answers and - voters would probably want more explanation for this segment that accounts for a third of the budget. So, effectively, I think this proposal would benefit from the team explaining what does NOXMON C2RM provide and why has it been chosen over other solutions. The NOXMON company's page is full of placeholder (dummy) text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without meaningful content, no commercial products are visible and the testimonial and other page are effectively placeholders.", "q2r": 3, "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "is_cs": false}, {"id": 1954, "title": "CARDANO DLT-360 RISK RADAR", "url": "http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnN4", "challenge": "F6: Cardano Emerging Threat Alarm", "q0": "Impact? Hell (pardon my French),  my opinion is that this is an amazing proposal. It fully encompasses the spirit of the challenge - which is to create a tool, a mechanism, a system that can alert the Cardano ecosystm and all of its moving and evolving parts of impending threats. But the thing that makes it exceptional is that this is a proposal tailored for the benefit of everyone - from Fortune 500 companies to the savvy personal investor. Everyone wants risk to be quantified and well presented. The problem with an up and coming new segment of the economy is that not everyone can do risk management on the fly. We need tools [surveys, databases, presentation layer], we need systems [DLT-360 RISK RADAR], we need reports [quarterly reports to the community], we need communication platforms a foundation for stability. I think this proposal does it.  Furthermore, the proposer does not reinvent the wheel - but helps Cardano to benefit from the existing ISO 31000 compliant risk management framework. Who the hell cares about ISO31000? Well big business and institutions do. ISO 31000 is an international standard that provides principles and guidelines for effective risk management. Win-win for Cardano and major players in e.g. industry, finance, education, healthcare or government who want to utilize a public blockchain and be able to assess risks. The proposer has been careful not to focus on a narrow slice of possible threats and has taken the hardest, but potentially the most rewarding (for the ecosystem) approach - by not prejudging outcomes and categories.  The Cardano blockchain itself is a very ambitious and exponentially growing techological platform, so it does need an equally ambitious risk alert system and the proposer also envisage a future path for the radar by proposing to develop terms & conditions for making this to a ongoing quarterly format. This is why I think this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let me sum it up first in one sentence. For me this is a five-star proposal for a novel, surprise challenge that was voted in by the community. A complex proposal such as this - for a system-wide challenge such as Cardano Emerging Threat Alarm - requires a special big-picture vantage point and an experienced team leader. The proposer seems to have these traits (the proposal's comprehensive approach is a big GREEN flag) and the fact that he is a prominent figure in industry makes the proposer a welcome addition to Catalyst. Specifically, the proposer is Heinz Gassner, the current Global Director Tech Supply / Digital Transformation Supply Operations at Anheuser-Busch InBev the world's largest brewer.. The information is available on the proposer's Linkedin profile. Mr Gassner  has more than 30 years of experience in leadership positions. I see a firm and promising structure such as a sensible implementation plan and a well-thought roadmap for emerging challenges, including securing a certain degree of independence, but balancing it out with maintainance of ties to the Cardano Community and/or Cardano Foundation. I especially like the fact that the proposer has provided a summary for community advisors (and voters) addressing (1) Impact / Return of Intention (2) Feasibility and likelihood to succeed and (3) Auditability. For voters what matters is that this is NOT a solo moonshot attempt by an individual as the proposal envisages the setting up of a diverse team of inter-disciplinary contributors from industry-, university, regulatory partners and specific subject-matter-experts. Two alternative revenue streams are proposed for the sustainable operations of CARDANO DLT-360 RISK RADAR. Communication channels are to be provided, a roadmap and a MVP-version of the services to the Cardano community. The output will be two live examples (in FEB/MAR 2022 and then in MAY/JUN 2022) of a quarterly report to the community with proposals on the further path ahead. Definitions of success were provided. I can't wait to see the product. One final note, the proposer is offering to co-finance part of the implementation by absorbing certain costs (specifically for Team formation, Delivery of draft- and MVP version of the reporting service, Summary and terms & conditions for making this to a ongoing quarterly format). I say power up the engines & full steam ahead. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "If this is about clarity and auditability (spoiler alert: it is) - well good, good and great for the proposer, Mr Gassner  - as I would want this guy writing my project proposal for anything in life. Be it a job application, a proposal to build a new school gym or ... drumroll create and implement a Cardano Emerging Threat Alarm. Is it auditable? It clearly is with 3, 6 and 12-month mileposts and deliverables. There is a public launch date for Q1 2022 with a complete MVP service presentation live in Q2 2022... Is the proposal unclear about something essential? No. Is it auditable? Yes. The deliverables and stepping stones are all there: formation of a frontend core-team of high-reputation experts, formation of the required backend team, development of basic strategies, structures and processes, implementation of ISO 31000 compliant risk management framework, establishing the basic tool environment (surveys, databases, presentation layer)... and so on.. until the product is set up for development, slapped into shape and set free for the community to benefit. We have to be aware that what is being proposed for development here is a unique product/structure - not a DApp, not a smart contract, not a developer tool or an SDK. It's not a \"hire-me-a-programmer\" type of problem and solution. It is a step-by-step approach to to address all the 'complex technological, economic and social components' that accompany blockchain-related risk specific to Cardano. For the benefit of the small guy and the big players. And the proposer wants to do this by implementing a professional risk assessment process following the ISO 31000 industry-standard. It's time to release the beast of a proposal that this seems to be, put popcorn in the microwave and make Cardano even greater again.

The proposer suggests to create an app/web location to capture threats from Cardano users and then categorize their threat level based on the system algorithm.  This might be a very good step to implement if it was followed by a real plan for developing the application and system logic and a forward view on how it could function. This proposal to me screams \"IDEA\" and not \"real implementation plan with specific milestones and deliverables\". It almost coincides with the name of the challenge, but is careful not to delve into too many (any?) specifics. The proposer should demonstrate more forethought, planning and consideration of possible paths, platforms, alternatives, mechanisms and choices that will be made in implementing the project. What are the hurdles to effective implementation? As it stands now, the proposal is so generic, so bland, so lacking in any detail that it is difficult to criticize it for any failure in planning. Namely, there is no specific plan - apart from a few sentences. So, my advice is to start setting up a team and explore the idea - as a possible MVP and plan to deliver the MVP and explore alternatives to how this could be done and what are the difficult design choices. \r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "OK, so the proposer hasn't included a professional biography and detailed competencies apart from generic statements This could be easily improved by providing a link to his/her Linkedin profile and projects that have been successfully realized - if any.

There is so much that could go wrong in a project like this, but none of this is given any consideration in the proposal. The worry for me is that if the proposal is this bland (I strongly encourage the proposer to improve it in further rounds if it is not approved in this one) - then the outcome/product could be of a similar nature.

Whether the proposed app or website will really deliver on its functionalities is up in the air - as the only promised functionality is to \"develope a capture/intake process for perceived threats.\" No specifics apart from that ... and truthfully an app/site that invites email submissions would clear that extremely low bar. I would suggest to the proposer to revisit his proposal (if it is not approved this round) by thinking long and hard about a vision of the future in which his app/website works. Imagine how success looks like, in your head. Imagine how problems emerge. Imaging how you overcome these problems. This mental map for the future will help guide some design and system decisions today. Don't limit your proposal to an idea. Have a clear vision of the future .. and then write the gory details down in a proposal, the nitty gritty, what works, what will not work, analyze competing solutions in similar platforms for capturing perceived threats, also look at practices in other functioning systems.

So, with its limited scope, I would expect a laser-sharp mechanism for  identifying serious emerging systemic threats. The proposal aims to look at how global regulation may pose a threat to cryptocurrency business models - by harnessing a future network of expertise that would \" identify and respond to emerging regulatory threats\". This is the proposed solution. I would have liked to see at least a worked out structure or possible options for this future network of expertise. I would have liked to see more on the \"respond\" part. What are the responses that could be available? Further on, the proposer does identify specific sources of regulatory threats and lists them. However, while the idea aspect of the proposal seems valuable ... for me the expected impact seems elusive. The proposal does address a subset of problems for blockchain, yet I am not sure how it will add specific value to the  Cardano ecosystem - when compared to other existing publicly available and expert sources of information on global regulation. Information is information. But the value of information is in its quality, timeliness and reliability. Although the proposer suggests to identify members of the Cardano community in key jurisdictions around the world (e.g. US, EU, China, Japan, Switzerland, etc) who could act as sensors and report on regulatory developments.. for some real impact I would have liked to see specific and clear criteria for these \"sensors\" and a reasoning on how to select \"key jurisdictions around the world\" for Cardano - apart from listing five jurisdictions that first come to mind. As the proposal does not specify even a structure and competencies and activities for future organization (will it have or engage the services of legal experts on securities) - its impact remains vague. Will it channel expertise from other blockchain systems and how - thus maximizing the resources? To me the proposal still reads as not sufficiently baked. What I would suggest is more focus - especially as the proposal has already narrowed down the field of threats to one subdomain. If regulation is the theme, then impact can be gauged if there are some innovative action strategies and innovative approaches for this network. What happens if new regulation is reported by the sensory network? Maybe we can read about it also in the cyrpto media? What is the value proposition, precisely? I do not see an original value that will make me believe that this proposal will have impact. It may be implemented, it may set up \"an operational regulatory sensing network\" - but how will this disparate network of sensors bring true value that is actionable - is a question that the proposer might want to explore in more detail. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal will probably identify members of the Cardano community in key jurisdictions around the world (e.g. US, EU, China, Japan, Switzerland, etc) who could act as sensors and report on regulatory developments. But that may be too low of a bar to hop over. My worry relates to the feasibility of providing the proposed solution (\" identify and respond to emerging regulatory threats to cryptocurrencies\"). Will this network be sufficiently competent? Identifying people willing to act as sensors and report for monetary compensation is one thing, but finding experts who are able to understand very intricate legal niceties that often require years and years of legal, taxation, anti-money laundering, law enforcement requirements, KYC issues,  or securities law expertise may be a completely different ball game. It seems that this network in this current rudimentary form - with no criteria - will not achieve a successful implementation, as we need a solution to the problem, not just a network that is set up. What do voters get here as the end result - is a question that is at the forefront for me and which might  need more consideration from the proposer. The criteria for identifying these people and the wide range of competencies that are needed - is for me a critical component for success and making the proposal feasible. The network will not be successful if the proposed solution (\" identify and respond to emerging regulatory threats to cryptocurrencies\") is not implemented. I would want to see proven legal experts, tax experts, domain experts and even other institutions involved in some way. We need some yardsticks to measure success here - not only setting up a network of sensors. The proposer does mention that he has \"good contacts on technology regulation around the world\", however blockchain regulatory issues often have very little to do with technology regulation - and more to do with taxation, securities laws, monetary law, economic policy, general wide-ranging pro-blockchain or anti-blockchain legal and political decisions. I am not convinced about the feasibility of even properly identifying the real regulatory threats in these jurisdictions based on the current proposal and I am also much more curious about the second part of the solution - how to \"respond to these threats\". One of the three deliverables will be a proposed approach to incentivizing participation in the network - although it seems to be too small of a deliverable to be included as a definition of success. Another deliverable is the \"proposed structure for future organization of this effort\" - which has no metrics for success, so the proposed structure might be delivered in a sentence or two: \"a loose network of sensors has been established and it will meet for one hour per month\". The proposal seems too loose to be able to deliver on the solution: to successfully \" identify and respond to emerging regulatory threats to cryptocurrencies\" around the world. As for the budget, there is subjectivity in this segment. The proposer specifies \"The proposed budget of USD 9000 (USD 1500 / month) is intended to be modest compensation for the time required on this effort over the first six months\" . I would advise the proposer to provide an explanation for the budget - as there is no allocated time in the proposal, a compensation rate, nor can we use a universal definition of \"modest compensation\" - when voters allocate funds from the budget. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "If we look at the proposer's solution - \"identify and respond to emerging regulatory threats to cryptocurrencies\" - then I would disagree that there will be sufficient information to audit the progress of the proposal and its success. We may be able to determine whether the proposer identified candidates for deliverable #1 in 3 months, whether a structure for future organization of this effort has been proposed in 6 months and whether the \"operational regulatory sensing network\" has been set up in 12 months. But that's about it. These are all preconditions for the solution - but the targeted problem is essentially not been addressed. A structure is being built and put in place - and that the real grind - is then to start. However, as we cannot see who will be in the network (their core competencies, their core experience) - we might end up with a body that is there in name only, the checkboxes have been checked - but the value is not there. So, my suggestion to the proposer would be to be more rigorous with the concept - convince voters that they will get a first-class network of expertise and how will they get it. What are the ideas for operating this new sensor network?

He has already started on the market research part and held a post-Catalyst-town-hall break-out room which showed a real interest and will to participate from the community.\r\nIn this sense, it's highly probable that he would be able to find support among the community to advance his researches (as what happened with the Game Changer wallet - a very impressive and promising wallet - developer who joined as a co-proposer).\r\n\r\nThe plan is sound however and asks the right questions in the correct order to make real tangible progress on the matter.\r\n\r\nGiven all of this I would give a 4 on feasibility. There are many uncertainties remaining for such a high and undetailed budget but this research is essential to our community and even an incomplete success would already be successful.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The need and the end goal are very clearly explained as is the definition of success (availability of a clear indicator of the trustworthiness of a smart contract in users' wallets).\r\nI regret the absence of risk evaluation though.

As it is we can only trust that the proposer can realize such research and deliver useful and working prototype.\r\n\r\nKey Progress Indicators are clearly defined though (protocol drafts, use of the developed trust metadata in deployed SC, CIP if needed...), and the proposer is a known figure of the community who put his reputation in line so we can trust he will try his best to deliver.\r\n\r\nThe auditability of this proposal is therefore quite clear and well defined and counterbalances the absence of risk evaluation and lack of technical early progress.

In addition, Clanity seems to be a project which aims to build on Cardano in tokenised form hence asking for funding to build its infrastructure as well as conducting a token sale seems to be double-dipping. Conventionally, projects secure funding from the token sale, so if Catalyst provides the funds instead, any amount raised and allocated to the team from the token sale purely becomes reward rather than payment for the services of building its infrastructure. This does not bode well and could be a pre-cursor to questionable tokenomics. I would suggest that this proposal is revisited for a later funding round, explain clearly the reasons why the funds are requested and clarify its impact on tokenomics due to a separate token sale.

The proposal describes the common trajectory of building a token-economy with timelines and roadmaps clearly presented, but it is missing the detailed information to provide confidence regarding how each of the identified amounts will be spent.

Every dapp that requires price feeds is as secure and resilient as its oracle. What would be the estimated cost of an attack on nodes? I couldn't find information about this in the whitepaper or in the attached video. In the video, the intention to implement a slashing/reputation model was mentioned, but there is no estimate for this, so the feasibility of the proposal is in question. Providing price feeds by itself is not a complete metric, you also need metrics to assess uptime and security, as an attack on the oracle could harm several dapps that are using the price feeds.\r\nThe project's CTO stated in the interview that only the team is running the nodes, so the security of any dapp depends on trusting the Charli3 team, which is far from ideal and centralized. There is no resilience in using an oracle if there is only one price feed provider.\r\nOne of the problems that staking-based oracles have is that the cost of an attack will be associated with the market capitalization of the tokens used as collateral. Because of this, oracles that have low market cap cannot guarantee security for dapps with high market cap, as there is an imbalance of incentives that allows an attacker to gain influence in the network by obtaining nodes and making a stake. If the attacker has the majority of nodes and identifies some dapp that has dependence on Charli3 as a source of price feeds and this dapp has a high value allocated in contracts, there will be an incentive for attacks.\r\nIt is important to note that there is a prototype in development and the CTO mentioned that once the prototype is ready they will look to create a community.\r\nIt is not clear from the whitepaper what the incentive for a data provider is and without an incentive there is no way to create a robust and decentralized oracle network.\r\n It is also unclear whether the project will have problems with concurrencym.

There is a case where this is a true DeFi API in my understanding, but I'll touch on that later on.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "First, let me start off by saying I love the idea behind the application. It would be a great idea to have one single application to service several different purposes as mentioned in the proposal: food delivery, plumbing services, care workers, and a combination of those and much more gigs. There usually is a reason there are different applications for different services, because otherwise I don't know how the UI of an application that deals with all kinds of gigs would look like.\r\n\r\nI really like the extensive roadmap, although I hoped the app would be self-sufficient from some point on considering the 1-5% fee they would be charging.\r\nAnother thing I like was the LinkedIn credentials that were posted because that adds an extra layer of credibility to any project, especially for people with so much experience.\r\n\r\nA few questions arise having read the business plan which states: \" For the consumer, all\r\ntransactions are conducted in fiat unless the customer purchases our token and stores it in their Youbiquitor wallet. Then they\r\nwill be able to choose between using their crypto wallet or a traditional payment method for each transaction.\". \r\nAs I understand it, this means that people will be able to choose between a fiat and a crypto payment method, which has one important distinction. We have two situations:\r\n\r\n* Users of the platform can pay in some crypto token - this can utilize smart contracts which will be able to automatically verify the proper amounts in the user wallets, and a transaction between them would be safe. As stated in the examples given in the business plan about a plumber that works for a commission.\r\n\r\n* Users of the platform can pay in fiat  - now let's assume the users want to choose fiat as payment. This would mean one of two things: paying with cash or a bank transfer. Based on the business plan document the users will input their billing information in the application along with KYC which would incentivize correct actors which is great. The only problem is, once the smart contract executes and moves money from the client to the service provider through a fiat bank account, even though the smart contract would have done its job, there's nothing stopping the client from calling their bank and reversing the payment. In crypto this is impossible, but with the regular fiat centralized system you can just call a bank and code is not law.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I was wondering about is the fact smart contracts can deal extremely well with automated executions, because this is what they were designed for, but what they have a hard time of enforcing in human behavior which should be guided by the agreement in a smart contract. Because this sounds too abstract, let me share the example I found in the business plan:\r\n\r\n\". Karen is impressed with Lewis and they agree to a specific rate for\r\nthe tasks and lock in a smart contract that includes Karen paying for her son's and Lewis's\r\ndinner. She then goes into her profile and selects from the option 'order again' to make\r\nordering her favorite meals as easy as possible. Karen 'stacks' the task to be executed within the same transaction as her contract with Lewis. She selects the option to allow Lewis\r\nto complete the task and he is automatically connected with the restaurant upon Karen\r\nfinalizing the transaction. Lewis gets a notification to confirm the pickup time with the\r\nrestaurant and is given the address to pick up Karen's son as well as a contact at the school\r\nthat will meet him at the designated pick up spot. Lewis schedules himself to pick up his\r\nclient first and confirms an average ETA with the restaurant. He arrives at the school a few\r\nminutes early and sends a text to his point of contact at the school identifying himself\r\nand his vehicle. After meeting and confirming the pickup of his new client, he navigates\r\nto the restaurant to pick up dinner and then proceeds to Karen's house where he cares\r\nfor his client until Karen returns home\" \r\n\r\nThis sounds amazing but there are several points where the smart contract wouldn't be able to help like, what happens if Lewis doesn't pick up the food for some reason and does everything else. \r\n\r\nI love the idea, but the implementation left me a bit wanting. It looks like a regular application that doesn't take full advantage of the decentralization and security features of the blockchain and relies on regular fiat transfers that can't take full advantage of smart contracts.\r\n\r\nOverall I think it's a great idea and you should definitely continue to work on in future funding campaigns.

That leads me to the question of why are they in a separate allowance category different than marketing since they are a kind of specific marketing.\r\nAnother thing I didn't quite understand is the mentioning of brand loyalty. From all the articles I read, I was left with the impression that loyalty comes after your brand is at least known and used for some time. By the proposal execution plan, you'd have 2 months to create a loyal user base keeping in mind you have competition as you mentioned in the face of Instagram and Pinterest, and other pet-related sites and platforms, which is quite ambitious.\r\nFor future proposals, I'd recommend keeping to shorter and more concrete timeframes along with expected KPIs to enable measuring your success and helping your supporters to believe in your end goal. \r\nI do believe you can make an application as you describe it, but I'm not convinced it will have the impact you want it to have, keeping in mind the lack of economic moat of the application.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I don't believe there is any way of tracking any kind of progress besides the end result, which would be a finished application.

Also, the collaborative approach to design during month 1 is likely to increase impact, as the proposal team are open to input from the community, although I'm not sure if there's quite enough time and resources given to this \u2013 what if community input identifies a major issue that needs to be resolved?\r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure that the project's approach will suit Catalyst, given that many documents are created by a group rather than a single owner, and are intended to be shared with and owned by the whole community \u2013 who, then, is technically the \"owner\" who would pay for the translation? And is there a danger that a service like this might shift the balance so that those who write a document in English might start to say \"Well, if someone wants it translated, they can pay for it\"?  \r\nI'm also not convinced how much people will care about the gamification element \u2013 but I could be wrong, and the point is that it will be tested during the project, so it could turn out to be impactful; and even if not, the project will still work and have a good impact without it. But the issue of translator rewards being worked out based on their evaluations \u2013 how would this work in the early stages, when nobody has any evaluations? Would low initial rewards put translators off, and mean they would prefer to negotiate with material-owners directly, who they may already know, rather than building up their reputation on this platform?\r\nIn short, the proposal *could* have really good impact, but it's hard to be sure -  the proposers could do more to explain the value of its specific features in this specific (Cardano/Catalyst) context. \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers clearly have the needed relevant experience and skill; their past projects look user-friendly and well designed, and seem to have been well managed and implemented effectively.\r\nThere's a very clear roadmap and milestones, which is good in itself, and also helps with managing risk. Still, I would like to have seen some explicit description of what the team see as the risks of the project and how they will mitigate them.\r\nOne obvious risk is how the project would onboard sufficient good quality translators; because when the platform is launched, if there are not enough translators or they are not good, this will instantly damage people's wish to use it. So it's a slight worry that there are no specific budget resources or time in the roadmap for outreach or recruitment to get translators on board. It's probably intended as part of \"developing and testing\" in months 3-6, but it would help make feasibility clearer if it was specifically addressed.\r\nThe budget is well broken down and doesn't look excessive; but it is a slight concern that it is almost all the funds for this challenge, which means that if funded,  it would block out almost all other proposals. But this feels acceptable, since it is a complete and scalable approach that could have a longterm impact on future translation needs, whereas most other proposals begin and end with translating this or that specific material.

(The proposal doesn't mention how the ideas might be disseminated, and how a wide range of people in Catalyst might be enabled to engage with them so that they actually do have an effect. Possibly the proposer considers that out of scope - but in academia, for example, post-doc researchers need to show some kind of plan for public engagement in order to secure funding; this proposal would better address the challenge if it recognised the importance of public engagement to spread ideas through the ecosystem and make them accessible.)\r\n\r\nStill -  contributing to scholarship around distributed systems is a worthwhile thing to do, and even if it never directly influences the day-to-day workings of Catalyst on the ground, it may well  contribute to Catalyst's thinking on the issues of this challenge; and without that, where are we?

What he is asking for is actually more than many people in my country (a first-world one) live on. This seems unwarranted.

Aside from the added effort to the people creating content, I don't think it would be very effective since:\r\n1. Like Steven said, scammers use live videos, which this intro would not apply to.\r\n2.

Worse, it could also attract media attention, the same way some Bitcoin scams have done it, making even people currently uninterested in Cardano think it's something bad.\r\n- they put a strain on Charles and other IOHK officials, which we, the community, should try to protect them from, if we can (Charles has received death threats about this, so it's not unlikely that other IOHK employees will get them as well.\r\nOtherwise, I think that the proposal is properly placed in this challenge, since to my knowledge, non-English speaking people are the most affected by this problem, which will negatively impact our ability to grow Cardano's community hubs.\r\nDue to the above mentioned reasons and the fact that no metrics for success have been mentioned, I have to disagree for now that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

It's good that relevant experience has been mentioned, but it also has to be backed up by a reference, in my opinion.\r\n- The proposer should identify and clearly outline what type of people are needed to work on this proposal (they were mentioned in the relevant experience section, but they should be identified by role) and how he would recruit them\r\n- The roles identified above should be used in the budgeting section (e.g. Animator-10h/$100, Editor 10h/$100, Writer, Narrator, etc). As it stands, the budget is too general to be convincing enough in my opinion. I don't have experience in the process of creating ads or films from scratch, but $100 per hour looks arbitrary to me at the moment. The campaign budget of $1000 per month also looks arbitrary. It should be clarified what platforms are targeted, how much running ads on them costs etc.\r\nThe website budget is also too general (we need to know every role and the associated costs). Note that in the meantime, this page (https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) was created by IOHK for reporting scams.\r\nRegarding the text translations: I think the hourly rate is a bit steep there as well ($20-30 seems more realistic after a bit of Google searching). Also, in my opinion research would be necessary to identify what regions the people who are falling for the scams most are and target those languages first. Just deciding to translate into an arbitrary 100 languages would be inefficient.\r\n- A clear timetable of what would be done, when and by whom would also help the proposal build more credibility\r\n- As mentioned earlier, I think the proposer needs to consider the problem and the possible solutions more and thus also outline the risks associated with the proposal's approach and how they would mitigate it.

I think the problem statement is pretty easy to understand, even for beginners. As a recommendation however, I think that the message would be more impactful if a consequence of the stated observation were also mentioned. For example, \"Proposers don't know how to make their proposals understandable to voters and this can result in valuable ideas not getting funded.\" This adds a bit more urgency to the statement.\r\nThe solution to the problem is adequately stated, I believe and it's aligned with the challenge itself. \r\nWhat is lacking here, in my opinion, is the clear formulation on how this would bring value to the ecosystem. As a voter, I like to see this clearly stated in the proposal, instead of it being left up to me to figure it out by myself. People unfamiliar with Cardano, who maybe just started voting this round, can get overwhelmed by the amount of content they need to decide whether to fund or not, so the proposals need to be as clear as possible, if they hope to gain their votes.\r\nAn example of the goal could be as follows: \"At the moment, many proposals on Cardano, while good ideas in themselves, are too complicated, too poorly structured and poorly communicated to convince people to vote for them. Moreover, even if they are voted, they sometimes don't get completed successfully due to the above mentioned reasons. The service we provide here aims to change proposals to be smaller in size and scope, but better defined and planned, so as to not only attract more votes, but then also to be more likely to be implemented successfully.\r\nI think the KPI's for the proposal are defined ok for the most part, though I have the following observations:\r\n-  I don't exactly understand the first measurement. It's stated that the goal is to increase higher score proposals by 10% (3.8 being the threshold for a proposal to be high score). Should not the goal be to track what score proposals which use the service get, compared to the score regular ones get? (Difference in score of applicants using the toolbox and those not using the tools.)\r\nFor example, let's say that in Fund 7, there are 110 proposals in total. 10 of these used the service mentioned here (so 100 did not). Then, we look at how many normal proposals got more than 3.8 score (let's say 40 out of the 100 \u2013 that's 40% of them). Lastly, we look at how many proposals which did use the service got over 3.8 score. Let's say 6 out of 10, meaning 60% of them. 60% of proposals which used this service got over 3.8 rating, vs 40% of proposals, which did not use the service. That's a flat 50% increase in the number of proposals which got over 3.8 score.  \r\n-\tThe goal to get one person to publicly create a proposal using the Miro board, which already has an example, sounds feasible in my opinion.\r\n-\tThe average people per workshop session and number of views per video per week sound feasible as well.\r\n-\tI don't understand perfectly what team the last metric is referring to. How many people from any team willing to try out this service will participate in the workshop? Or is it something else? Is this intended to track the number of people using the service overall?\r\n-\tA metric for measuring what specific problems which entrepreneurs face right now will be fixed by this service is missing. Perhaps it would be useful to establish a few clear concrete objectives in the workshops and then analyze proposals which use the service after they are finalized, to see that the objectives are fulfilled. For example, perhaps proposers don't state their budget needs clearly and the service can take it upon itself to make sure that proposals it coaches don't have this problem anymore. This can be easily tracked after proposals are finalized.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan on how the proposal is going to be implemented sounds pretty straightforward and I feel confident the proposer will deliver, but I think a few things are missing for this section. I'll start with the good points and then move on to the feedback:\r\n- The proposer has been a member of Project Catalyst since August 2020 and has contributed to dozens of proposals over time. This makes me more inclined to believe that he will deliver. Moreover, he has already facilitated workshops, which is a big plus and the Mini-proposals idea looks fleshed out to me.\r\n- The proposer has a Miro board with examples of what this service would produce, the specific approach on how it will do that and also with details about the Mini-proposals idea and how to scale it.\r\n- The proposer has provided a detailed breakdown of the time costs of each separate part of the proposal and the $18 average hourly rate is by no means exaggerated for the task, in my opinion. The 20% extra also seems fine to me and I believe this is contingency for unexpected problems down the road.\r\nNow the less good:\r\n- The proposer has not mentioned who the people fulfilling each role will be, nor how they will be identified (assuming that has not been done already). This is the biggest uncertainty regarding the proposal, in my opinion and should be rectified if possible (or at least not repeated in the future).\r\n- It is not clear to me what the difference in responsibilities between the Solution Architect and the Facilitator are.  Could role responsibilities be stated more specifically please (at least in the future)?\r\n- The proposer could have added his LinkedIn page here as well (as done in the Video content about Mini-Proposals related proposal), to add more details about himself.\r\n- While a buffer has been mentioned for unforeseen problems, I think it would also help make the proposal more solid if a few risks were mentioned in it. My first concern is that it's not clear whether the team which is supposed to handle the workshops is assembled yet or not. If it is, are there contingency plans in case they cannot attend some workshops? If it is not and people need to be recruited, what happens if not enough people can be found in time?\r\n- While the Miro board contains a lot of useful information about the Mini-Proposals idea (kudos!), it would have been very helpful for both voters and CA's to place a big pointer to the specific Mini Proposals as a Service example we should look at.

I think that voters who will see this proposal before the \"Treasury for Mini-Proposals\" and \"Mini Proposals as a Service\" ones will be a bit confused (as I was), until they read all 3 of them. However, I don't believe the average voter has the time / patience to do that. I would suggest that if a term which references some content or idea that an outsider is not familiar with is used, it should be explained in the \"Describe your solution to the problem\", as clearly and concisely as possible.\r\nExample:  Showcase Mini-Proposal workshop sessions in easy to consume video formats. Mini proposals are a new approach which implies coming up with smaller proposals, allowing entrepreneurs to get funded and deliver faster.\r\nFollowing up on the point I made above, I feel the proposal could have done a better job of explaining how it actually adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. The implication from the problem statement is that more proposals will help the ecosystem grow, which is easy to understand, but the solution to the problem recommends the Mini-proposal approach, which again, is not adequately explained here and is an important caveat, I believe. My suggestion would be to have a more detailed statement here, like the one from \"Treasury for Mini-Proposals\": \"We introduce proposers to a new process where we can go through the funding process faster compared to the Catalyst process. (...)\"\r\nIn regards to the key metrics for this challenge, I feel like the proposal is a bit lacking here: the authors included measurements for tracking the popularity of their videos once they are out, but I think the main metric to be measured here is the actual adoption rate of the Mini-Proposals approach and the increase (or decrease) in proposals and proposers in the coming funds. In other words, people might watch the videos but not adopt the ideas presented in them.\r\nGoing through the related proposals linked here, I can see there are more details about these metrics, but I don't feel like this approach is correct.

It would help to see that the proposer has thought of issues like, for example, if one of the (possible?) contributors is not able to deliver on their responsibilities, due to other engagements and how they would address that.\r\n- While the Miro board contains a lot of useful information about the Mini-Proposal idea (kudos!), I'm afraid I don't see the relevance to this particular proposal, which is just about creating useful short videos with condensed information on this topic. I apologize if it's here and I'm missing it. My concern is that it might confuse a voter who's trying to find information about this particular proposal on the Miro board (as I was).

I have the following concerns:\r\n- While the tasks are broken down neatly, I know from experience that when certain tasks are blocked until others are fulfilled, figuring out how long it takes to do something is not just a simple summation of every separate part. For example, here, the editor cannot start working on the videos until he has requirements of what to do from the content manager. I think for the auditability to be great, it would have been nice to address this problem and how it would be solved (one idea is to send out the requirements in small batches and often, not to do them for a bunch of videos and then send them all at once to the editor). Again, this is assuming there are more people working on this proposal.\r\n- While an end date is approximately mentioned (\"content starts to be published just before Fund 7\"), the start date is not. It might be that work on this is ongoing, as indicated by \"The goal is to get videos out in 3 days, right now it takes about 6 days without any major edits.\", but I think it could be mentioned more clearly.

The proposal offers to create, in full, a large-scale Cardano based software system that combines something like a language learning platform like DuoLingo with a quest based, massively multiplayer online game, while supporting eleven languages up to the A2 level of the CEFR scale (CEFR = Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).  Either one of those top level tasks is a huge project in itself.  The proposal does state that the funds requested are to be augmented by the team via other fund-raising efforts outside the Cardano treasury.  But I have no way to vet or to assess their likelihood of success in that fund-raising.   The proposers may want to consider next time positioning their request as a pilot program or research project, with the stated intent to seek further funding in successive proposals.  That way assessors can estimate the proposals probability of success without that estimate made cloudy by the need for funding outside the proposal.  Normally a relatively small fund request by a proposal makes it easier to accept it, since there is less risk of it displacing other proposals with merit.  But here, weighed against the size of the intended deliverable, it instead reduces my confidence that a usable deliverable will be created. The proposers are obviously energetic and devoted to their projects, so I sincerely hope they come back in F7 with a tightly focused proposal of reasonable scope and get the funds they seek.

This proposal outlines a solution to be added to the Cardano developer toolset that should make integrating outside databases with the Cardano blockchain a well-defined, straight-forward process.

I think it would also be important to hire a designer to make graphic material to publicize the event, even to circulate among the channels they already have, with a lot of visibility.

The author explains well about how dapp works, that, for example, users can have better control over how companies and brands use their personal data through direct monitoring. Furthermore, according to the author, Profila selects some crucial information from the contract between brands and users, such as what data will be made available and for how long the use will be allowed. In fact, these are variables that most of us (myself included) have no idea how they operate, and it's super beneficial for the consumer to have a handle on such information. After a long detail of how dapp works, the author of the proposal explains how the Cardano ecosystem technology would be used, which is basically to make the contracts accessible to everyone and better manage the payment rates that involve the case transactions.

For example: caves and cemeteries, buildings with various props, such as chairs and tables... what is the connection? I thought, unfortunately, the vision became too abstract.

I think it was very important that the author also clarify how he intends to promote the game in the gamer community, it would be on which platform?

But during proposal development, translation is focused on town halls. So it would be beneficial if the authors confirmed that this would be the first content for translation and then gave a sense of how, little by little, other content in the Cardano ecosystem could be translated, because promising to translate everything without setting a goal that is easier to visualize is complicated. .. We are told which languages \u200b\u200bthey intend to address, which is a positive point. But because there are several, it would be important to know, for example, which would be addressed first. It was a little vague how the community would have access to the translated content; I believe that every proposal must establish a solid point between what is done and who is intended to benefit from the idea. For these reasons, I believe the impact of the proposal is high, but it needs detailing.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We are provided with little information about the authors. We know that they are translators, and that they have a website, which was attached, on which they intend to develop tools to facilitate the work of future translators. Tools such as: dashboard and direct communication channels between people hired. However, we do not have a deep background about their work. It would be very positive to attach some townhall or forums that they translated, and even introduce us to who the other people involved are, as we are told that there are already translators who were working for free. I think it was necessary to leave this network of contacts a little more exposed in the proposal. The site they have attached is very good, you can see that they know what they do: what we lack is more demonstration.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the applicability of the project, I believe it is the most detailed part of the proposal. We are told what is intended to be done in certain blocks of time (3 months, 6 months and more future steps), and also how the financial amount would be used. About detailing, we have a pretty safe notion, however, that could be further broken down. Let me explain: on the part of the money destined for the website, for example, they ask for 500 dollars to keep a job for 6 months. Okay, but what job is this? I thought they needed to explain more about how they were going to build the site, which despite being well underway, still needs to be filled with more content. Of course, a UI/UX designer must be a contract, because having access to the translations in a simple and direct way is as important as the fact that the translations exist. The self-worth (in my opinion) requested for town hall translations is justified by the fact that future translators are well trained. It would even be positive if some website or content were attached that explained more how the Frankfurt School operates in this blockchain universe, because most of us evaluators do not know its work and would add value to the proposal. It is also positive how the authors establish success metrics, so the community could better track the progress of the project. Thus, although we already have a good sense of information about how things will happen in practice, some issues are still confused, lacking clarification, but in general I found the auditability satisfactory.", "q2r": 4, "no_vca": 10, "ne": 9, "is_cs": false}, {"id": 4519, "title": "Swahili News, Insight, Onboarding", "url": "http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBmmY", "challenge": "F6: Grow Africa, Grow Cardano", "q0": "This proposal perfectly meets the main objective of the challenge, as it establishes a solid bridge between the Cardano ecosystem and native Africans, specifically Swahili speakers. He would also meet the challenge of translating Cardano's contents into other languages. I found it very interesting when the author of the proposal mentioned that he is in contact with a group of young people who have recently arrived from Kenya, from the fields of journalism and technology, because it demonstrates that he has a direct connection with the audience he intends to reach and already has candidate translators for your content library. It is also very positive that this library includes contents from the basic to the most advanced in the universe of cryptocurrencies, because the proportion of people who are unaware of this universe to those who are already aware of the concepts is quite significant.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Certainly the duo that created the project is well trained, but lacking in detail.

It is always positive that linkedin profiles are attached, if they have them, because that way we can get to know more deeply who they are. Regarding the rest of the team, which from what I understand is made up of the site content writers (developers) and the future translators from English to Swahili, we don't have any information about them (a developer named Darlington is mentioned, but the information is shallow), which unfortunately leaves its presence somewhat abstract for us.

They also outline an action plan based on quarters, which gives us a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat will happen over time. However, as it is a long time, it would be interesting if the activities of each quarter were grouped in order of occurrence and more detailed. Regarding budget breakdown, we know how much money will go to each professional, knowing what he will do and for how long. A detail that I thought could have been explored further was the convection of the audio content for the site; how would they be made available? Would a person be hired exclusively for this, or would the translators themselves record? One more detail that I found crucial and didn't see mentioned: disclosure. This proposal is very positive and important, and its benefits should reach the maximum number of readers possible, both African and from other places. It would be important to draw up an outreach plan for the site!

The idea is extremely positive in terms of introducing the Cardano universe to the African continent, and its target audience is a portion of the population that is essential for the future of blockshain: young people. Especially economically disadvantaged young people, according to what is said in the proposal. In this way, the objective of involving and reaching the maximum number of natives on the continent, giving them support, since they are in a vulnerable situation is well aimed at. By teaching what Cardano is and how our ecosystem relates to daily life for children and adolescents, success is certain, as they will mature and use cryptocurrencies in the next stages of their lives, in addition to disseminating this knowledge to their acquaintances . Also relevant is the fact that MCA already exists, it is an institution with a history, that is, the work will be to merge the Cardano universe with pre-existing practices, which is certainly more practical than creating a school from scratch.

This way, you are very sure who you are and the ability to carry out the project.

In other words, everything is very well detailed in terms of what will be done and in what sequence, as well as how students and employees would benefit. The only thing I was a little doubtful about was how it will all happen: who would they be and how would they find the donors? There is also a notion of dates here, we are told how long each step would take, and which month we would be talking to, for example. Therefore, I think the auditability was very well executed (the detailing of actions and phases), as well as the descriptions about the team.

The author claims to have experience with digital marketing and a type of strategy called SEO, which works by searching for keywords, and through this strategy he would promote his project. However, it would be interesting to explain better how the strategy works. We know that this site will be created, which will operate using keywords that relate to cryptocurrencies, blockchain, NFT, etc., in French. But we don't know how, for example, how this content will reach the target audience. Through pop ups? This, in my opinion, is not a very good idea, because people tend to close pop ups without even reading what is there, often pop ups are also related to malicious content, such as viruses, for example.

In addition to not having a more detailed explanation of who the author is, he does not demonstrate that he has planned to hire more members to form a team. I believe that to carry out this project, it would be important for there to also be a graphic designer, whether for the creation of the website or the pop ups, and it would also be positive if more than one person was responsible for the translation and creation of the content.

For example, who would write the content? And how often would they be created and released? A lot of content is promised, for example, from month 2 to month 3 the goal is to produce 100 contents. It would be important to understand who would draft them and how often they would be published. I believe that the implementation of the proposal could be much more detailed.

According to the author, this solution will make Ada more valued and Bitcoin will lose some of its dominance in the cryptocurrency market. But is it really? In my view, it's a bit illusory that a single project will make such a profound transformation in the way cryptocurrency holders see the possibilities. I believe that the best way to value Ada, Cardano and all the assets that involve our community is to promote several projects that bring a real positive impact on the world, as has been done through financing funds, and as the number of supporters of Ada grows, the currency will also gain more power and with that it will appreciate. The idea that this entire process is boiled down to a single action seems to me too ambitious and far-fetched. I think it would be positive if 1) the author redefines with a more realistic vision what he intends to achieve with the release of Hard Blue 2) that it be better explained how the project would work, as I will detail in the comments below. We also don't know if Hard Blue would work through a dapp, as the challenge seeks.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "About the author, little is known.

Unfortunately, we don't have any information about who the team is. We are not presented with names, functions, a brief description of their professional trajectories so far, making it very difficult to visualize what they are capable of doing.

Nor how community would follow the development of the project. I found it unrealistic when the author says that all the funding money would go to advertising and the team would work for free, with what motivation would they do this?

The author spends a lot of time explaining how the issue of open or semi-open regime of information coined in the blockchain would be, but he leaves out of the explanation crucial details for the analysis of the proposal. For example, at the beginning we have the knowledge that this is a consortium of companies focused on the food sector, and links through which we can obtain more information about each one of them. However, we do not know who the people involved actually are. Only a few people from these companies would be part of the project, do you agree?

The author highlights the relevance of this translation work, since more than 20 countries have Spanish as their official language, and a large number of residents in the United States also speak this language. This proposal differs from the others in the challenge because in addition to translating existing content, it is intended to create an event aimed at exchanging various content, be it videos, books, design pieces, all aimed at the Spanish-speaking community, and whose theme would be content about our ecosystem I found the idea of \u200b\u200bpromoting challenges during the event very interesting, which would have rewards in ada as a prize. So, the event would not only attract new people, but active members of the ecosystem, which would help move the community. Another very positive point I found here is that the event will be organized in axes, which encompass several aspects relevant to the community, such as: why Cardano is the best environment for creating Dapps, the advantages of investing in ada, etc. for a very solid plan, we also noticed flexibility regarding the project's progress, which I consider very important for the success of the idea.

On the formation of a team, the author states that \"this type of campaign is better approached in a more 'guerrilla' way than trying to form a small fixed team\"; it would be interesting to argue why, and also how workers would be selected, how long on average each team's work would last, until it was replaced. As the proposal involves the creation of different types of content, there would certainly be a need for different types of professionals on the team in addition to translators, such as designers, blockchain / ada / cardano specialists...

I realize that Cardano Week is an event of great proportions, involving several small activities, which together form a whole (with which much is promised). But precisely because it is so broad, it would be important for the community to have a more concrete understanding of how it would all happen. For example: would the Cardano Week really last for 1 week or is it an illustrative name? How often would this happen? Where, exactly, would this content be made available (the author cites what part of the funding would be for marketing and social media, but which media)? Furthermore, how would the billions of people that the author mentions in the introduction of the proposal know about the event? In addition to all these questions, it would be interesting to know what these challenges the author intends to promote during the event, in addition to the rewards in ada, what would be the learning related to them...

What worries me here is how this content freedom would be done, because certain things do need to be censored, such as: adult content (if the DApp is open to any user, it is inappropriate for minors to have access to this type of content); content that is morally offensive to any group, and so on. I think the lack of censorship needs to be thought about, an idea I had is: the user would need to prove their age to access the DApp (it could even an Atala Prism ID when it was launched!). Anyway, it's an interesting idea, but it doesn't involve the use of NFT, as the challenge calls for.

And we can see in a more individual way who they are, their names, photos and a very short description about their professional activities. My suggestion is that this description be further elaborated and attached to the proposal itself (not just on the website), so that we could get to know the team members more intimately. It would also be interesting if they demonstrate through examples some of their projects already launched, for example, people who work with games of chance. What games are these, were they successful, and if not, why? What would you change in this game?

The team also sets the milestones achieved so far, which is very positive because it demonstrates that work is already being done, regardless of the funding round.

As it is a complex and long proposal, the authors divided the stages based on quarters, but for each quarter the activities are only mentioned in topics.

In marketing we would also need more information, it is not mentioned at any time how the advertising campaign would be carried out, that is, through what type of media, channel and target audience.

The question is, would he do it all himself? It is not clear whether the author intends to hire other professionals to develop the project as well, which would be ideal, in my opinion, or not. We can see through the description of the proposal that he understands a lot about the technique that involves the project, however, we do not know if he is a developer (probably not), so it would be necessary for him to make clear the intention to hire one and also specify what type of developer would, after all a large part of the funding would go to that person.

Let me explain: David (the author) does not specify how he would select meeting guests. How is he going to decide who are the right people to call for the event, and furthermore, how is he going to convince them to take the time to listen to a lecture on the subject? It was also not very clear how often these meetings would take place, at one point he states that they would be bimonthly, then every 2 months a new meeting would be created, or the same meeting (with the same contents) would be repeated in this period of time ? Another thing, it is not said how long each meeting would last, if it would be all in one day, nor why the city of Moudon (in Switzerland) would be a good place to hold them.

I also had the impression that the project itself would be quite expensive for what it proposes, for me it would be valid for the event to be recorded, broadcast, posted somewhere, registered and widely publicized so that it reached the maximum number of people. The author even mentions that part of the money would be earmarked for the communication and marketing sector, but it would be positive if he clarified this information further, what kind of marketing would be done, how, where?

Regarding the roadmap, we have here a sketch of how things would happen, both in terms of phases and financial expenses, which gives us a rather satisfactory view of the project's next actions, but just as I had the impression in relation to those involved, this part could have been more detailed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We know that educational content about the Cardano universe will be produced, at an introductory level. What came to mind here was: what would that content look like, exactly? Would it be in written format, or videos...? And where would it be taught? How many people do they intend to cover with this initial course? Afterwards, the authors detail more about other stages that make up the project, such as participating in events and developing a more advanced course. We are also given information about how the currency split would take place. However, it lacks detail. For example, in the part citing \"recruitment, encouragement and collaborative coordination of the quarterly French-speaking African population\", what exactly would that look like? We could better understand what this incentive would be like... would students receive a scholarship, would they have job opportunities after completing the course? Regarding the marketing and design campaign, it would be important to understand how this marketing content would be done (through the creation of a visual identity, promotional posts on social networks, etc), and how the bridge to the target audience would be drawn. Regarding the hiring of teachers, it would be positive if they clarify how many education professionals they intend to hire and whether they would be Africans or not. Because this is important: perhaps a local teacher would have more credibility in dialoguing with his students, understand them and be able to transmit the contents in a more efficient way than, for example, a European or North American teacher who was not part of the African context.

The only problem I found here was the fact that he didn't show interest in hiring any other professional to develop the proposal.

As I mentioned in the previous comment, it would be important to clarify with Atala Prism users that they would know about this possibility, how they would learn to use it. Would it be important to include some kind of instruction in this regard, when Atala Prism is released, would information be provided about address simplification? I think it's also important to establish some kind of monitoring, so that the community could monitor how many users would be using the tool, and that this was constantly mentioned so that no one would stop using the benefit.

Theoretically, it is a very relevant project, the problem is that I, as a Brazilian citizen, am not sure if it is possible for us \"ordinary\" citizens to suggest such a feat. It would be very positive if, during the proposal, the member Lilian Correia, who is a social scientist, explained to us readers how this works here in Brazil, is it really possible to make interventions such as bills?

That way we would be more confident about their abilities to successfully execute the project. This proposal is quite complex, which makes me think that it would take several developers working, and not just the fixed member of the team. In terms of sharing expenses, they say that 60k of the funding would be for developers, in the plural, which shows that they intend to hire other professionals in the area. But they don't specify how many, and whether they would all work during the entire project execution or just in some phases, for example. Another question that is not very clear is: what is the relationship of the team members with the Cardano universe, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, etc? It would be necessary for them to demonstrate a solid mastery of this universe or to have the intention of hiring someone who did, so that we would be more certain that there would be someone there who was prepared to perform such tasks.

Reading the proposal, it is understood that Brazilians would be holders of the Cardano Blockchain and Ada (and in the future the ID of Atala Prism), but it was important that it be confirmed. Through which channel would the disclosure take place, if the site would only go into operation after the official launch of Atala Prism... I also had the following question: why Brazil? I would like to understand why the authors decided that such a proposal would be relevant for our country. Although everything involving politics is highly bureaucratic here, as they mentioned that to access government public data here it would be through a PDF on a website (it would be nice if they posted the PDF or the website link), we also need to consider the fact that the share of Brazilians who know and use the blockchain is still very low. Perhaps this proposal would be more suitable for a future financing, some time when the technologies of our community were more popular among Brazilians. There is a brief explanation on how the financial amount would be divided, but as I mentioned, it was necessary for them to detail how many developers would be working on the project and how, how the marketing campaign would be, etc., and so we would also understand how each installment of the funding (very high portions!) would be used.

One observation I make, however, is that it would be important (as I said in the comment above) to know some examples of teams that were mentored by them, what kind of guidelines were given to them in this orientation and where they managed to go after the \"consulting\", because that way we would have a practical demonstration of the work promised here, which would increase credibility and confidence in the team.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As to how this idea would be put into practice, we unfortunately have few details.

Another issue is that, despite there being an explanation about what would happen each month and how much money would be allocated for it, this explanation was shallow, lacking in detail. For example, in month 1 the development of the incubator would take place, but who would work on it, exactly? Would it be a developer along with a designer? In months 1-4 a good amount of funding would go towards supporting the incubated projects, but how would the breakdown between them? In equal parts, or proportional to the complexity of each project?

For future proposals, in order turn this from a good to an excellent proposal, I suggest providing some context behind the current state of African education financing.

It is a very important area for developing countries as the supply chain is highly inefficient and abuses farmers and nature. \r\n \r\nWhen I was at Earthwrom.org, I worked for a couple of years on the agriculture supply chain including coffee and I am well aware of the importance of such a solution but also of its complexity. \r\n\r\nIt is great that the proposal considers how to pilot the model, scale it in one country and then share the knowledge with other countries.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the proposal deal with a very important area, some information is missing about the feasibility of the project. \r\n\r\nIt makes sense to have two teams one traceability team and one developer team. But there is no information about either of the teams, their background, and the relevant experience. The team is probably the most important factor for the feasibility of the project and with general information, it is difficult to evaluate. \r\n\r\nThe plan vs. the idea makes sense and especially it is good that you start focusing on one region. I worked with many startups (i.e. mentoring at seedstarts.com or givingway.com) and focus is very important and will help to make team, plan, budget all aligned. \r\n\r\nThe budget has the main elements in it but it is difficult to assess as it does not show how ten budget was calculated.

For example, how many farmers, cooperative, and traceability entities do you plan to work within each timeframe.

I do not discount that the proposers have the capacity to deliver this project based on what is provided. Why I am not giving this proposal full marks is because I think the plan could be fleshed out a bit more. While I am sold on the idea for the proposal, it is unclear that the demand for such a service is coming from the location which has been identified. It leaves me wondering if the proposers have engaged potential universities already, if so, what level of buy-in was there, and have they clearly indicated their support? Is the location chosen on proximity to the proposers? \r\nI do think that the indicators, budget, and timeline seem reasonable, but again I think that there is an assumption that buy-in will be strong from the Malaysian universities, governments, and other state apparatuses that are part of ID issuance and information sharing between entities.

Given that there is not a distinct breakdown beyond high level categories, voters must trust that the team can deliver and that the amount requested is necessary. For example, the proposers include Development=60,480 and Research & Development=3,000 but there is no indication of how these are different. Moreover, what does \"development\" entail that \"research and development\" doesn't? While I am not saying this is necessarily suspect, it doesn't provide enough granularity for the community to know how the money is being spent. To get a higher score I would encourage the proposers to explore such avenues.

In addition, the fact that the proposer outlines that this is an open source project, the community will have ample opportunities to test out the product, adapt it, upgrade it, and so on. This intention to return the final product to the community also can give faith to the community that this project will be implemented successfully. The proposer is encouraging this dialogue, which is a necessary step in building voter confidence. \r\nI must also note that at first when I read the budget I thought it was a bit high but completely reasonable, given the potential for disruption such a system could have. The fact that the proposer then cuts that budget in half and will incur half the costs themself is a true testament to their commitment.
